Java Collections Framework.

The Java Collections Framework provides a well-designed set of interfaces and classes that support operations on a 
collections of objects. These data structures are foundational elements of programming, and you'll find them enormously
helpful for organizing and processing data in your applications.

At a high level, the framework consists of:

    Interfaces: These are abstract data types representing collections. Examples include the Collection, List, Set, Queue,
    Deque, and Map interfaces.

    Implementations: These are the concrete implementations of the collection interfaces. In essence, they are reusable 
    data structures. Examples include classes like ArrayList, HashSet, LinkedList, HashMap, PriorityQueue, and TreeMap.

    Algorithms: These are methods that perform useful computations, such as searching and sorting, on objects that 
    implement collection interfaces.

Here's an overview of some key interfaces and classes:

    List Interface (and ArrayList class): A list is an ordered collection (also known as a sequence). The user of this 
    interface has precise control over where in the list each element is inserted. ArrayList is a resizable-array 
    implementation of the List interface.

    Set Interface (and HashSet class): A collection that contains no duplicate elements. More formally, sets contain 
    no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that e1.equals(e2), and at most one null element.

    Map Interface (and HashMap class): A Map is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys; 
    each key can map to at most one value.

    Queue Interface (and PriorityQueue class): A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. Queues 
    typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO (first-in, first-out) manner.

    Deque Interface (and ArrayDeque class): Deques, short for double ended queues, are a type of queue in which we can 
    insert and remove elements from both ends.

The Collections Framework also includes functionality for algorithms (like sorting and searching), arrays 
(which are, in fact, fixed-size lists), and "wrapper" classes (which can provide synchronicity and immutability,
among other things).
