Java Standard Libraries and APIs:
The Java standard libraries are a set of dynamically loadable libraries that Java applications can call at runtime. 
The libraries provide useful functionality for common programming tasks, and they are a major reason why Java is such a 
powerful language.

The Java standard libraries are part of the Java API (Application Programming Interface). The Java API is a collection 
of prewritten classes, which are free to be used in your programs. They are grouped into libraries of classes and 
interfaces; these libraries are known as packages.

Here are a few packages from the standard libraries that you will likely use frequently:

    java.lang: This package is automatically imported into every Java program. It includes classes that are fundamental 
                to the design of the Java programming language, such as Object, String, StringBuilder, Math, and the 
                wrapper classes for the primitive types (Integer, Character, etc.).

    java.io: This package contains classes for system input and output through data streams, serialization, 
                and the file system.

    java.util: This package contains the collections framework; legacy collection classes, event model, date and time 
                facilities, internationalization, and miscellaneous utility classes like Arrays and Objects.

    java.net: This package contains classes for network support, including URL, URLConnection, Socket, and ServerSocket.

    java.sql: This package provides the API for accessing and processing data stored in a data source, usually a 
                relational database, using the Java programming language.
