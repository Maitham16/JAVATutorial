There are three types of control flow statements in Java:

    Decision Making Statements (if-then, if-then-else, switch): These statements allow your 
    program to choose different paths of execution based on an expression or the state of a 
    variable.

    Looping Statements (for, while, do-while): These statements allow a block of code to be 
    executed repeatedly based on a condition.

    Branching Statements (break, continue, return): These statements are used to alter the 
    normal flow of execution.
