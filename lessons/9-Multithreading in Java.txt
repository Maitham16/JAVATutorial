Multithreading is a feature in Java that allows you to write programs that do multiple 
things concurrently (at the same time). A thread is a lightweight, smallest part of a 
process that can run concurrently with other parts (threads) of the same process.

Java provides built-in support for multithreaded programming. It's important to 
understand the concepts of multithreading as they can be very useful in improving 
the efficiency of programs that need to perform several tasks at once.

Here are some key concepts related to multithreading in Java:
Creating a Thread: You can create a new thread by either extending the Thread class 
                    or implementing the Runnable interface.

Thread Lifecycle: A thread goes through various stages in its lifecycle, such as New, 
                    Runnable, Running, Blocked, and Terminated.

Thread Priority: Each thread has a priority which helps the operating system determine 
                    the order in which threads are scheduled for running. In Java, you can 
                    set the priority of a thread using the setPriority(int) method.

Synchronization: Synchronization is used to control access to shared resources by multiple 
                    threads. This is done using the synchronized keyword.

Inter-thread Communication: Java allows communication between two or more threads. This is 
                                done using methods like wait(), notify(), and notifyAll().

Deadlock: Deadlock can occur in a situation when a thread is waiting for an object lock 
            that is held by another thread, and this second thread is waiting for an object 
            lock held by the first thread. Both threads are waiting for each other to 
            release the lock, and as a result, they both keep waiting forever. 
            The situation is essentially a standstill.

Understanding and correctly implementing multithreading can be a bit challenging but it's a 
very powerful concept that can drastically improve the performance of your Java application, 
especially for tasks that are CPU-intensive or that need to handle multiple I/O operations 
simultaneously.
