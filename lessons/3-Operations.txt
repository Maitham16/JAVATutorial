In Java, operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, 
two, or three operands, and then return a result. Operators are used in Java to 
manipulate data and variables.

Here are the different types of operators in Java:

    Arithmetic Operators: These are used to perform basic mathematical operations.
        +: Addition
        -: Subtraction
        *: Multiplication
        /: Division
        %: Modulus (returns the remainder of a division operation)
        ++: Increment (increases value by 1)
        --: Decrement (decreases value by 1)

    Assignment Operators: These are used to assign a value to a variable.
        =: Simple assignment
        +=: Add and assignment
        -=: Subtract and assignment
        *=: Multiply and assignment
        /=: Divide and assignment
        %=: Modulus and assignment
        &=: Bitwise AND assignment
        |=: Bitwise OR assignment
        ^=: Bitwise XOR assignment
        >>=: Right shift and assignment
        <<=: Left shift and assignment
        >>>=: Zero fill right shift and assignment

    Comparison (Relational) Operators: These are used to compare two values.
        ==: Equal to
        !=: Not equal to
        >: Greater than
        <: Less than
        >=: Greater than or equal to
        <=: Less than or equal to

    Logical (Boolean) Operators: These are used to perform logical operations.
        &&: Logical AND
        ||: Logical OR
        !: Logical NOT

    Bitwise Operators: These are used to perform operations on bits.
        &: Bitwise AND
        |: Bitwise OR
        ^: Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)
        ~: Bitwise Complement
        <<: Left Shift
        >>: Right Shift
        >>>: Zero Fill Right Shift
